# For Users

This application allows users to sign up using their credentials like Name, Email, Password, Age and also select an appropriate time slot for their Yoga Classes.
It then performs basic form validations and alerts the user in case of any discrepancies.

Users are then prompted to enter their Payment Details namely their Card Details and then alerts them if the payment is successful.



# For Developers

It has a Client and Server backend made using MERN.
The MongoDB Database uses a User Schema to create new users using the form data and stores it into the Atlas DB.

# Here is the ERD for the Database
